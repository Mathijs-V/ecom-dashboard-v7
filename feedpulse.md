With the feedback that we got during our meeting we've changed the project charter as well as scheduled a meeting with the company to clearly outline what we will & won't do during this project.
Last week we gathered sales data for the company so their accountant knows exactly how many sales they got from bol belgium, bol the netherlands and their Belgian & dutch orders on their webshop.
